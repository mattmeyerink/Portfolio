                    In September, 2016 I begain attending the University of Michigan. I began 
                    taking the prerequisites necissary to attend to medical school while applying
                    to be apart of the Movement Science major through the School of Kinesiology.

                    In a tubing accident I tore my ACL, medial/lateral gastrocnemius, and a 
                    portion of the anterior tibial artery. For the next year I was in physical 
                    therapy several days per week perparing for surgery/recoving from surgery with
                    the goal of returning to exercise again.

                    After a rigorous application process I was chosen to be included in the school's
                    intraoperative neuromonitoring program. This program focused heavily on neuroanatomy
                    and types of neurosurguries with the goal of preparing us to work in teh operating
                    room during neurosurgeries.

                    Over the summer of 2019 I worked at the U of M hospital 3 days per week for 
                    my clinical rotations. These rotations involved working with established 
                    neuromonisotists in the U of M hospital to gain hands on experience. The goal 
                    of a neuromonitorist is to monitor the nervous system during invasive neurosurgeries 
                    with the goal of preventing or controling potential damage. These rotations taught us 
                    the hands-on skills along with the theoretical background to assist during neurosurgery.

                    The opportunity to work in surgery over the summer was the opportunity of a lifetime that 
                    I am very thankful for, yet it taught me that the clinical setting is not for me. The uncertainty 
                    of the hours, the stressfulness of the workplace, and the lack of problem solving made me realize 
                    I needed to try to change directions with my last year in college. So I began to branch out 
                    in classes my senior year in college to help me find a new path.

                    One of the classes I enrolled in was an introductory computer programming course in C++. 
                    I had done a little bit of introductory work through Codeacacademy before, but never anything 
                    this structured or in depth. In the first month of the class I was hooked. The prevelance of 
                    problem solving combined with the ability to write programs to solve real world problems was 
                    amazing too me. I continued to work hard within the class and outside of it to learn all that 
                    I could.

                    In March I was signed up to run the Ann Arbor Marathon as my first marathon. 
                    I had trained hard all winter, yet due to COVID-19 the event was canceled. 
                    However, with the help of friends and family I was able to run it on my own 
                    and finish infront of the Crisler Center (one of my favorite places). This was 
                    finally my big comeback from my boating accident.

                    In May I graduated from the Unviersity of Michigan. While my degree was still 
                    in movement science, I had found a passion in computer science that I had found 
                    in nothing else. Looking forward I sought to teach myself the skills necissary to 
                    transisiton into a career as a software develouper.

                    In July I made the move down to Dallas, TX with my close friends from college 
                    and my girlfriend. Still studying computer programming and attempting projects
                    on my own, I was excited about the job opportunities a big city would present 
                    and to experience a city outside of my home state of Michigan.

                    I decided to join Coding Temple to accelerate my learning as a develouper. 
                    I have the energy and the passion to put work into my learning, but I want 
                    the direction that the Coding Temple offers to make sure I am headed in the 
                    right direction. I also want the small learning setting where I can really 
                    engage with the material and learn through projects. I am eager to start my 
                    career as a software devleouper and I know that Coding Temple can help me get 
                    there.
