                    In September, 2016 I begain attending the University of Michigan. I began 
                    taking the prerequisites necissary to attend to medical school while applying
                    to be apart of the Movement Science major through the School of Kinesiology.

                    In a tubing accident I tore my ACL, medial/lateral gastrocnemius, and a 
                    portion of the anterior tibial artery. For the next year I was in physical 
                    therapy several days per week perparing for surgery/recoving from surgery with
                    the goal of returning to exercise again.

                    After a rigorous application process I was chosen to be included in the school's
                    intraoperative neuromonitoring program. This program focused heavily on neuroanatomy
                    and types of neurosurguries with the goal of preparing us to work in teh operating
                    room during neurosurgeries.

                    Over the summer of 2019 I worked at the U of M hospital 3 days per week for 
                    my clinical rotations. These rotations involved working with established 
                    neuromonisotists in the U of M hospital to gain hands on experience. The goal 
                    of a neuromonitorist is to monitor the nervous system during invasive neurosurgeries 
                    with the goal of preventing or controling potential damage. These rotations taught us 
                    the hands-on skills along with the theoretical background to assist during neurosurgery.

                    The opportunity to work in surgery over the summer was the opportunity of a lifetime that 
                    I am very thankful for, yet it taught me that the clinical setting is not for me. The uncertainty 
                    of the hours, the stressfulness of the workplace, and the lack of problem solving made me realize 
                    I needed to try to change directions with my last year in college. So I began to branch out 
                    in classes my senior year in college to help me find a new path.
